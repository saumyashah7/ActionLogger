----- Recommendations -----

Application fits into HBM.

Mode to use: If numactl is available, use the Flat-Mode with all allocations to HBM.

If numactl is not available, then use the Cache-Mode. However, note that the cache misses in the Cache-Mode are more expensive than reading data from DDR4 in Flat-Mode.

Memory Allocation: HBM
To execute the application in FLat-Mode: Use command < numactl --membind=1 ./run-app> if it is serial, or < ibrun --membind=1 ./run-app > if it is parallel. 

To execute the application in Cache-mode: Use the command that you normally use, that is, < ./run-app > if it is serial or < ibrun ./run-app > if it is parallel. 

In general, to determine the <NUMA_NODE> in the command < numactl --membind=NUMA_NODE > , run the command < numactl -H > and look for the node without any core
